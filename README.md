# Employee-Productivity-Analysis
**INTRODUCTION** :

   To advance the organization's development, we meticulously analyzed employee performance as a strategic initiative aimed at augmenting overall productivity. Organization
are constantly seeking ways to enhance productivity and efficiency. One of the key methods employed to achieve this is through data analysis. 
Data analysis is the practice of working with data to glean useful information, which can then be used to make informed decisions. Data analysis is the process of 
examining, interpreting, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. It involves various techniques and tools to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships
within a dataset. By analyzing data, organizations can make informed decisions, identify opportunities, solve problems, and gain a competitive advantage.
Data analysis is used in various fields, including business, finance, healthcare, marketing, and research. It enables organizations to make data-driven decisions,
optimize processes, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a deeper understanding of their operations.

**OBJECTIVE** :

   The primary objective of our employee performance analysis is to enhance organizational productivity and development. By systematically evaluating individual 
contributions, strengths, and areas for improvement, we aim to optimize workforce efficiency. Through this process, we seek to foster a more dynamic and collaborative
workplace, enabling informed decision-making and strategic interventions. The overarching goal is to unleash the full potential of our employees, promoting skill 
development, job satisfaction, and overall engagement. By aligning individual performance with organizational objectives, we aspire to drive sustained growth, 
maintain competitiveness, and ensure the long-term success of organization in the ever-evolving business landscape.


**OVERVIEW** :

   First, we organize and clean up the data. Then, we focus on important details, like figuring out which employees work a lot or a little and who takes more or
fewer days off. By understanding these patterns, we can make smart decisions to boost productivity. We identify hardworking employees and find ways to improve where 
needed. This careful analysis helps create a balanced and effective workplace, contributing to the overall improvement of how well the organization gets things done.
We employed Excel for a detailed analysis of the collected data. Leveraging its powerful features, we scrutinized employee metrics, work patterns, and leave records. 
Excel facilitated a comprehensive examination, allowing us to derive valuable insights essential for enhancing productivity and optimizing workforce dynamics within 
the organization.

**DISCUSSION** :

The primary objective revolved around gauging company productivity by leveraging attendance data encompassing employee ID, effort, status, performance, among other metrics. Excel served as the pivotal tool in this endeavor, facilitating data organization, analysis, and visualization. Through Excel's functionalities, insights into workforce efficiency and performance were gleaned, aiding in strategic decision-making and optimization of operational processes.

## RESULT AND SCREENSHOTS: 

The Figure showcases the results derived from an Excel pivot table, presenting a bar chart visualization correlating Employee Names with their respective Effort levels. This graphical representation offers a concise overview of each employee's contribution, facilitating easy comparison and analysis. we efficiently organized and summarized the data, enabling us to identify patterns and trends in workforce effort. The bar chart enhances understanding by visually displaying the distribution of effort across employees, aiding in performance assessment and decision-making processes aimed at improving overall productivity within the company.

It is important to note that to gain a more accurate understanding of the overall workforce, additional information and data should be considered. This may include performance metrics, tenure, and other relevant factors that can provide a more comprehensive view of the organization's performance and productivity. 

### New Join:

It shows that employees 03, 04, 06, and 18 are new hires. New hires often require training and time to familiarize themselves with a company's processes, systems, and expectations. During this initial period, it's natural for their output to be lower compared to more experienced employees. It shows that employees 03, 04, 06, and 18 are new hires.

It shows that the productivity rate of the mentioned employees is low, as they have taken more leaves than usual. This suggests that their absences have had an impact on their overall productivity.

 ### Problem In Timesheet Updation:

Each employee's timesheet showing what they accomplished during the workday. For each person's productivity to be calculated, it must be updated. Due to the aforementioned employee's incomplete timesheet, production has decreased.The data from the previous six months will be divided into weeks to examine each employee’s performance and boost a company’s efficiency.It is evident that the employee’s did not consistently update the time sheet.Because of this,It is less probable  that the productivity of  a company will grow as a result of an employee’s performance.
