# Employee-Productivity-Analysis
## 1.INTRODUCTION:

   To advance the organization's development, we meticulously analyzed employee performance as a strategic initiative aimed at augmenting overall productivity. Organization
are constantly seeking ways to enhance productivity and efficiency. One of the key methods employed to achieve this is through data analysis. 
Data analysis is the practice of working with data to glean useful information, which can then be used to make informed decisions. Data analysis is the process of 
examining, interpreting, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. It involves various techniques and tools to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships
within a dataset. By analyzing data, organizations can make informed decisions, identify opportunities, solve problems, and gain a competitive advantage.
Data analysis is used in various fields, including business, finance, healthcare, marketing, and research. It enables organizations to make data-driven decisions,
optimize processes, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a deeper understanding of their operations.

## 2.OBJECTIVE :

   The primary objective of our employee performance analysis is to enhance organizational productivity and development. By systematically evaluating individual 
contributions, strengths, and areas for improvement, we aim to optimize workforce efficiency. Through this process, we seek to foster a more dynamic and collaborative
workplace, enabling informed decision-making and strategic interventions. The overarching goal is to unleash the full potential of our employees, promoting skill 
development, job satisfaction, and overall engagement. By aligning individual performance with organizational objectives, we aspire to drive sustained growth, 
maintain competitiveness, and ensure the long-term success of organization in the ever-evolving business landscape.


## 3.OVERVIEW :

   First, we organize and clean up the data. Then, we focus on important details, like figuring out which employees work a lot or a little and who takes more or
fewer days off. By understanding these patterns, we can make smart decisions to boost productivity. We identify hardworking employees and find ways to improve where 
needed. This careful analysis helps create a balanced and effective workplace, contributing to the overall improvement of how well the organization gets things done.
We employed Excel for a detailed analysis of the collected data. Leveraging its powerful features, we scrutinized employee metrics, work patterns, and leave records. 
Excel facilitated a comprehensive examination, allowing us to derive valuable insights essential for enhancing productivity and optimizing workforce dynamics within 
the organization.

## 4.DISCUSSION :

The goal is to determine a company's productivity using attendance data such as employee id, effort, employee status, performance, and so on. In our endeavor to analyze employee attendance data and enhance productivity, we employed the powerful functionality of pivot tables within Excel sheets. With this approach, we efficiently organized and distilled the vast dataset into meaningful insights. Pivot tables allowed us to swiftly aggregate and summarize attendance metrics, including absenteeism rates, punctuality, and overtime hours, among others. This streamlined analysis enabled us to identify patterns, trends, and areas of concern with remarkable clarity.

  The above figure, depicts the outcome acquired from the pivot table in Excel, which includes a bar chart visualization of the Employee Name and their Effort.

**4.2 Lowest Production Employee** :

The maximum working hours for an employee are set at 920 hours. This allocation is typically split into 70% of the total hours, which would amount to 475 hours. However, it is important to note that some employees may have worked fewer hours than the designated 70% threshold.The employees with IDs 09, 10, 23, and 27 are currently exhibiting very low performance.

**4.3 Decreased Productivity** :

The employee status is depicted in above Figure, showcasing various categories including new hires, departing employees, and currently employed individuals.However, the figure only displays the employee with the lowest performance.

**4.3.1 New Joins** :
This deduction is made by considering the data presented in the table and taking into account the employee's attendance records and corresponding performance metrics.

**4.3.2 Continuous Leave Taken Employee** :
This suggests that their absences have had an impact on their overall productivity.,as this survey was taken based on the weekdays.

**4.3.3 Timesheet Updation Problem** :
The six months data will be divided into weeks to examine each employee’s performance and boost a company’s efficiency.It is evident that the employee’s did not consistently update the time sheet.

### 4.4 Highest Performance :

Figure displays the best performance of the employees who gave their jobs their all.The last month June might be highlighted in red color because there were less days provided to us (8/6/23) than in the previous months.

### 4.5 More Productivity :

Each month’s analysis has determined that these three employees have been more productive than others during the previous six months.

## FINAL RESULT :

The company should also take steps to reduce unwelcome absences and improve overall work quality. One way to achieve this is by implementing a leave policy that discourages employees from taking time off on Mondays and Fridays unless it is for an emergency or has been previously approved by management. This can help reduce absenteeism and ensure that employees are present when needed.To enhance their operations and success, the company should update time sheets, reduce absences, and establish open communication and continuous improvement. These steps require ongoing effort but can pay off in the long run by creating a more productive and engaged workforce, leading to improved work quality and employee productivity.

## CONCLUSION :

our analysis of the employee attendance dataset using Excel sheets yielded valuable insights crucial for enhancing company productivity. Through the strategic utilization of pivot tables, we identified patterns, trends, and areas for improvement, enabling targeted interventions such as scheduling optimizations and employee engagement initiatives. This project underscores the importance of leveraging data-driven approaches to drive organizational efficiency and foster a culture of accountability. By continuously monitoring attendance metrics and iterating on our strategies, we aim to sustainably improve productivity and contribute to the overall success of the company.
