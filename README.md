# Employee-Productivity-Analysis
## INTRODUCTION :

   To advance the organization's development, we meticulously analyzed employee performance as a strategic initiative aimed at augmenting overall productivity. Organization
are constantly seeking ways to enhance productivity and efficiency. One of the key methods employed to achieve this is through data analysis. 
Data analysis is the practice of working with data to glean useful information, which can then be used to make informed decisions. Data analysis is the process of 
examining, interpreting, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. It involves various techniques and tools to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships
within a dataset. By analyzing data, organizations can make informed decisions, identify opportunities, solve problems, and gain a competitive advantage.
Data analysis is used in various fields, including business, finance, healthcare, marketing, and research. It enables organizations to make data-driven decisions,
optimize processes, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a deeper understanding of their operations.

## OBJECTIVE :

   The primary objective of our employee performance analysis is to enhance organizational productivity and development. By systematically evaluating individual 
contributions, strengths, and areas for improvement, we aim to optimize workforce efficiency. Through this process, we seek to foster a more dynamic and collaborative
workplace, enabling informed decision-making and strategic interventions. The overarching goal is to unleash the full potential of our employees, promoting skill 
development, job satisfaction, and overall engagement. By aligning individual performance with organizational objectives, we aspire to drive sustained growth, 
maintain competitiveness, and ensure the long-term success of organization in the ever-evolving business landscape.


## OVERVIEW :

   First, we organize and clean up the data. Then, we focus on important details, like figuring out which employees work a lot or a little and who takes more or
fewer days off. By understanding these patterns, we can make smart decisions to boost productivity. We identify hardworking employees and find ways to improve where 
needed. This careful analysis helps create a balanced and effective workplace, contributing to the overall improvement of how well the organization gets things done.
We employed Excel for a detailed analysis of the collected data. Leveraging its powerful features, we scrutinized employee metrics, work patterns, and leave records. 
Excel facilitated a comprehensive examination, allowing us to derive valuable insights essential for enhancing productivity and optimizing workforce dynamics within 
the organization.

## DISCUSSION :

     The goal is to determine a company's productivity using attendance data such as employee id, effort, employee status, performance, and so on. To accomplish this, we used EXCEL.

   The above figure depicts the outcome acquired from the pivot table in Excel, which includes a bar chart visualization of the Employee Name and their Effort.

   Several significant issues were identified during our analysis, including low production levels among certain employees, declining overall productivity, challenges associated with integrating new hires, prolonged leave-taking by some employees, insufficient workdays logged, and difficulties in updating timesheets.

**Lowest Production Employee** :

     The maximum working hours for an employee are set at 920 hours. This allocation is typically split into 70% of the total hours, which would amount to 475 hours. However, it is important to note that some employees may have worked fewer hours than the designated 70% threshold.The employees with IDs 09, 10, 23, and 27 are currently exhibiting very low performance.It's important to address this issue promptly to ensure their productivity and overall contribution to the organization improves.

**Decrease in Productivity**:
### New Join :
    Upon analyzing the data from the past six months and dividing it into weekly intervals, a notable trend emerges, indicating a significant boost in the employee's performance during the 15th week. This observation leads us to speculate that this individual may be a relatively recent addition to the company's workforce.

### Continuous Leaves :
    The productivity rate of the employees is low, as they have taken more leaves than usual. This suggests that their absences have had an impact on their overall productivity.,as this survey was taken based on the weekdays.

### Low WorkDays :
    The drop in production appears to be linked to a rise in the number of vacation days taken by employees, particularly on Fridays and Mondays, with falling productivity on the remaining workdays as well. 

### Timesheet Updation :
    Each employee's timesheet showing what they accomplished during the workday. For each person's productivity to be calculated, it must be updated. Due to the aforementioned employee's incomplete timesheet, production has decreased.The data from the previous six months will be divided into weeks to examine each employee’s performance and boost a company’s efficiency.It is evident that the employee’s did not consistently update the time sheet.

**Highest Performance** :

    The above figure displays the best performance of the employees who gave their jobs their all.

**More Productivity** :

   The highest performance of the employee is highlighted in green.It proves that the worker is more productive for the business.

   The company should also take steps to reduce unwelcome absences and improve overall work quality. One way to achieve this is by implementing a leave policy that discourages employees from taking time off on Mondays and Fridays unless it is for an emergency or has been previously approved by management. This can help reduce absenteeism and ensure that employees are present when needed. Additionally, by reducing unwelcome absences, the company can improve overall work quality by 40-50%, particularly for employees who are struggling with performance issues. By providing consistent support and guidance, the company can help these employees improve their work quality and become more productive.

## CONCLUSION :

   Our analysis showed some big problems in the company, like some employees not working well, others taking too much time off, and issues with keeping track of time worked. To fix this, we need plans to help those struggling, better training for new hires, and improvements to how we manage leave and time tracking. By working together and focusing on making things better, we can make the company run smoother and help everyone do their best work.
